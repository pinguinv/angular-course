# AngularCourse

This is my first project in Angular. I made it from 2h yt course
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8&t=701s).
But when I finished watching video I found a little bug with button
(when you turn on form to add a task, go to the 'about' and return
to the 'tasks' page, the button will be red with word 'Close' on it)
and I fixed it myself! :D


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## JSON server

Run `npm run server` for a fake json server. The server will be on
`https://localhost:5000`, u can change it in 
package.json > scripts > server.
